## Why it matters

This project turns privacy compliance checks into a fast, repeatable workflow. It automates discovery of cookie consent banners, privacy policy links, contact info, and third‑party trackers, then summarizes risk with a clear score, grade, and recommendations. The result is a lightweight tool that helps teams prioritize privacy fixes and create shareable reports in minutes.

## What I built

- Single and batch scanning with clear scoring and exportable CSV reports.
- AI‑assisted policy review that highlights strengths, gaps, and remediation steps.
- Historical tracking with score trends (database‑backed) for ongoing monitoring.

## What I learned

- Building reliable web scraping with retries, timeouts, and HTML validation.
- Designing a production‑ready Streamlit UI with glassmorphism and performance‑friendly styling.
- Structuring a clean MVC‑style Python app and integrating external AI services safely.
